- train 256 10 latent comp on mask vae
- use higher beta constraint for 256 to disentangle azimuth (beta = 100) for most strict disentangled rep without posterior collapse
- use higher beta constraint for 256 to disentangle azimuth (beta = 50) for most strict disentangled rep without posterior collapse
- use higher beta constraint for 256 to disentangle azimuth (beta = 40) for most strict disentangled rep without posterior collapse
- train 256 with most strict disentangled rep on 64 mask to see results.
- condition mask latents on comp
