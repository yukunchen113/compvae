#### Experiment 1: Train BetaTCVAE, Create Mask by Randomizing Latents
This experiment will try to create a mask by randomizing nuisance latent variables. These should randomize latents according to correlation between the latent variable of interest.
There should be a degree of correlation between all of these variables since we are focusing on data that contain one object.
