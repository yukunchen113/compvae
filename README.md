## General Object Creation
Currently only supports simple transformations, projections etc.

### Shapes

### Transformations

### Projections

#### Polar
Points are converted to polar coordinates and mapped to the closest angle for farthest r

#### Linear
Points are rotated to be a linear projection on the yz-plane and mapped to the closest x in the direction towards -x direction 

### Anchoring
Points are paired with an identifier 

### Lighting
Special case of polar projection, intensity is multiplied by normal of surface.

### Coloring
